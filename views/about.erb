    <h2>ABOUT</h2>
      <p>I am a former professional modern dancer (creative stuff) who upon graduating with a political sciences degree in 2010, ended up working for three years in sales operations and financial analysis (not creative).  At some point, I was exposed to programming and my creativity started to boom again. The natural consequence was to leave my job and become a web developer.</p>
